R script is here: https://github.com/rsund/IODS-project/blob/master/data/create_learning2014.R
##Reading data:
```{r readdata,echo=TRUE,results='hide',message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
setwd("https://github.com/maivu2054/IODS-project/tree/master/data")
library(dplyr)
library (xlsx)
learning2014 <- read.xlsx("https://github.com/maivu2054/IODS-project/tree/master/data/learning2014.xlsx") %>%
  mutate_at(vars(gender), factor)
```

```{r }
```

$$
Y-i = \alpha + \beta-i x i + \epsilon-i 
$$
